# 📋 PCB Classification Project Documentation

## 📖 Overview
The PCB Classification Project aims to streamline the classification process of printed circuit boards (PCBs) using the advanced capabilities of the ChatGPT-4 Vision model. This approach addresses common challenges faced in traditional classification methods, particularly those related to the data validation loop, such as:

- 🏷️ Human error in labeling
- ⚖️ Disagreements in labeling
- 🕰️ Inefficiencies in the labeling process

## 🔍 Traditional Challenges
The repetitive and static nature of the labeling process often leads to inconsistencies and inefficiencies, making it difficult to maintain high accuracy and reliability. For example, if a model is trained to recognize green PCB boards as high-class boards and a high-value blue board suddenly appears, it requires:

- 🏷️ Labeling many new images
- 🔄 Retraining models

With this approach, however, adding a new feature is as simple as updating the System Description file with an additional sentence.

## 🌐 Future Proof
This project is designed to be future-proof as AI technology and OpenAI models continuously improve. As these models advance, they offer enhanced capabilities and greater accuracy, ensuring that our classification system remains state-of-the-art. The adaptability of the ChatGPT-4 Vision model allows for seamless updates, making it easy to integrate new features and improvements over time. This ensures that our solution not only meets current needs but also evolves to address future challenges and advancements in PCB classification.

## 🛠️ Methodology

### 📊 Classification Criteria
The criteria for classifying PCBs are as follows:

- **Printplaten AA**: Heavily populated with ICs and CPUs, almost no space left, no attachments like batteries, aluminum, iron, or capacitors.
- **Printplaten A**: Well populated with ICs and CPUs, no attachments like batteries, aluminum, iron, or capacitors.
- **Printplaten B**: Moderately populated, quality between A & C.
- **Printplaten C**: Almost or completely not populated with ICs, CPUs, or gold, often brown in color, heavy weight, with large capacitors.

### 🔄 Workflow
1. **📤 Upload Image**: Users select and upload a PCB image.
2. **📉 Image Compression**: The image is compressed to a manageable size for processing.
3. **📑 System Description**: Users can read the detailed criteria and classification instructions.
4. **🚀 Submit for Classification**: The image is analyzed and classified by the OpenAI GPT4-Vision.
5. **📊 Result Display**: The classification result is displayed on the main screen.

### 🔍 Testing and Validation
Given the complexity of the classification problem, minimizing the error margin is crucial for achieving accurate results. A robust validation dataset and a comprehensive validation pipeline are implemented, including:

1. **🗂️ Validation Dataset**: A large and diverse dataset of labeled PCB images is used to train and validate the model. This dataset covers various PCB types, colors, and component densities to ensure the model's versatility and accuracy.
   
2. **🔍 Validation Pipeline**: The validation process involves rigorous testing of the model against the validation dataset to assess its performance. 
    - **❌ Error Analysis**: Identifying and analyzing misclassifications to understand the model's limitations and areas for improvement. The model can output the reasoning behind the classification, and special instructions can be given to the prompt to process extreme cases (e.g., with batteries) in predefined ways.
    - **🔧 Model Tuning**: Although fine-tuning is not a present feature, it will be available in the near future.
    - **💰 Budget Tracking**:
    Effective budget management is crucial for the financial viability of the project.
        - **📊 Cost Analysis**: Continuously monitoring API call expenses and other related costs to identify trends and potential overspending.
        - **📅 Budget Forecasting**: Projecting future costs based on current usage patterns and planned expansions to ensure adequate funding.
        - **📈 Financial Reporting**: Regularly generating reports to provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the project's financial status, including any potential risks and necessary adjustments.


The goal is to continuously refine the model through iterative validation and tuning, ensuring high accuracy and reliability in PCB classification.

## ❓ Questions and Concerns

### 💲 Cost of Implementation
The primary cost associated with implementing advanced vision models involves API calling. Frequent and extensive use of the OpenAI API can lead to significant expenses, particularly with high volumes of data processing. Additionally, the high volume of PCB waste that needs to be sorted can further increase costs. Budgeting for these ongoing and potentially high costs is essential to ensure the project's financial viability.

### 🔒 Data Privacy and Security
Sharing data with OpenAI for model improvement raises concerns about data privacy and security. It is essential to ensure that sensitive information, especially proprietary PCB designs, is adequately protected and that data sharing complies with all relevant regulations and company policies.

### 🤝 Dependence on External Providers
Relying on OpenAI and similar providers for ongoing updates and improvements can create a dependency that might be risky if there are changes in service terms, costs, or availability. Ensuring a backup plan or alternative solutions is crucial for mitigating this risk.

### 🧩 Figuring Out the Prompt
Determining the correct way to instruct the AI model should be an iterative process. Handling edge cases effectively is crucial for the project's success. 
- **🔄 Iterative Refinement**: Continuously refining the prompt instructions based on the model's performance and feedback.
- **📑 Documentation of Edge Cases**: Thoroughly documenting edge cases and the corresponding instructions to ensure consistent handling of similar situations in the future.
- **🧪 Experimentation**: Regularly experimenting with different prompt configurations to identify the most effective instructions for accurate classification.
