            ## E-Waste Statistics

            - In 2019, around 53.6Mt of WEEE was generated worldwide, with 12Mt assigned to the EU.
            - The secondary materials contained in this e-waste are estimated to be worth $57 billion.
            - Electronic Waste stocks are increasing at an alarming rate of 2MegaT per year.
            - It is projected that the global generation of WEEE will exceed 74Mt by 2030.5.
            - Only 17.4% of the global e-waste generated in 2019 was reported as collected and recycled by official WEEE management schemes.
            - In Europe, 42% of European WEEE is collected and recycled, with around one half in the EU.
