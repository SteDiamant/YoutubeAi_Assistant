# 📋 PCB Classification Project Documentation

---

## 📖 Overview

The PCB Classification Project aims to streamline the classification process of printed circuit boards (PCBs) using the advanced capabilities of the ChatGPT-4 Vision model.

### This approach addresses common challenges:

- 🏷️ Human error in labeling
- ⚖️ Disagreements in labeling
- 🕰️ Inefficiencies in the labeling process

---

## 🔍 Traditional Challenges

The repetitive and static nature of the labeling process often leads to inconsistencies and inefficiencies.

### Example:
If a model is trained to recognize green PCB boards as high-class boards and a high-value blue board suddenly appears, it requires:

- 🏷️ Labeling many new images
- 🔄 Retraining models

---

## 🌐 Future Proof

This approach is designed to be future-proof as AI technology and OpenAI models continuously improve.

### 🔮 Top 3 Upcoming Features in Vision Models

1. **🔍 Enhanced Object Detection and Segmentation**
2. **⏱️ Real-time Processing and Analysis**
3. **🤖 Self-learning Capabilities**

---

## 🛠️ Methodology

### 📊 Classification Criteria

- **Printplaten AA**: Heavily populated with ICs and CPUs, almost no space left, no attachments like batteries, aluminum, iron, or capacitors.
- **Printplaten A**: Well populated with ICs and CPUs, no attachments like batteries, aluminum, iron, or capacitors.
- **Printplaten B**: Moderately populated, quality between A & C.
- **Printplaten C**: Almost or completely not populated with ICs, CPUs, or gold, often brown in color, heavy weight, with large capacitors.

### 🔄 Workflow

1. **📤 Upload Image**: Users select and upload a PCB image.
2. **📉 Image Compression**: The image is compressed to a manageable size for processing.
3. **📑 System Description**: Users can read the detailed criteria and classification instructions.
4. **🚀 Submit for Classification**: The image is analyzed and classified by the OpenAI GPT4-Vision.
5. **📊 Result Display**: The classification result is displayed on the main screen.

## 🔍 Testing and Validation

### 🗂️ Validation Dataset

A large and diverse dataset of labeled PCB images is used to validate and evaluate the model. This dataset covers various PCB classes and different edge cases.

---
### 🔍 Validation Pipeline

#### ❌ Error Analysis

- Identifying and analyzing misclassifications to understand the model's limitations and areas for improvement.

- The model can output the reasoning behind the classification, and special instructions can be given to the prompt to process extreme cases (e.g., with batteries) in predefined ways.

#### 🔧 Model Tuning

- Although fine-tuning is not a present feature, it will be available in the near future.

---
#### 💰 Budget Tracking
##### Effective budget management is crucial for the financial viability of the project.

- **📊 Cost Analysis**: Continuously monitoring API call expenses and other related costs to identify trends and potential overspending.

- **📅 Budget Forecasting**: Projecting future costs based on current usage patterns and planned expansions to ensure adequate funding.

- **📈 Financial Reporting**: Regularly generating reports to provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the project's financial status, including any potential risks and necessary adjustments.
